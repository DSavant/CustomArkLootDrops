# CustomArkLootDrops

Improved, yet not OverPowered, Beacons  
The goal here is to improve the default beacons and crates in ARK  
#How to Use?  
* Take the compiled one line version and put it in your game.ini file.  One line per crate, must be under the game [ ... ] header.  
* For the double crates, change as you wish. I changed a few numbers and thats it. I'll update more on this later.
