# CustomArkLootDrops  

_Improved, yet not overpowered, default beacons._  

As of June 20th 2016 the crates are complete and working and feel pretty good on our server, yet are still being revised and balanced. Be aware that this is a Work In Progress...  

### The Goal  
The default beacons are notoriously _dissapointing/bad_. How many times have you found a medium crop plot blueprint in a red or yellow? How about that compass blueprint? Water jar blueprint anyone? Everyone have enough of those yet? Good, lets make those happen less often then. The goal here is to improve the default beacons and crates in ARK, and yet not make them Crazy Overpowered (as most people that mod them seem to make them). I do not wish to replace/make useless the Sea Crates or Cave loot crates, or break the game with these replacement beacons here. In general, they should drop stuff that is useful to players of all levels (small chance of eggs, polymer, crystal, cementing paste, etc) and have a small chance of having higher quality gear.

##How to Use?  
* The easiest way to use this is to copy all the code from the file *FULL_DEPLOY_CODE* and paste it into your *game.ini* file, anywhere under the [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]. Then Save your server and restart it (be sure to warn your players so they dont lose stuff/can land their fliers, all that standard stuff). If you are still stuck on this, there is a lot of additional information out there about editing your game.ini file, just search Google.
