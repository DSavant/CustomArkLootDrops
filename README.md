# CustomArkLootDrops  

_Improved, yet not overpowered, default world beacons._  

> First Complete Version is done - 6/29/2016. Look out for further revisions to be slowly and carefully released.

The default world beacons are notoriously _disappointing_. How many times have you found a _Medium Crop Plot_ blueprint in a red or yellow? How about that _Compass_ blueprint? _Water Jar_ blueprint anyone? Does your tribe have enough of those yet? Some tribes have even made a game out of seeing *how many Bookshelves they can fill with one of these patterns*. 

### The Goal  
The goal here is to improve the default World Beacon crates in ARK, and yet not make them crazy overpowered (as many who edit them seem to make them - to each his own). I do not wish to replace/make useless the Sea Crates or Cave loot crates, or break the game with these replacement beacons here. For our server we wanted a healthy balance and crates that would improve the overall quality of the game. With this diligent crate re-code modification, the beacons will become more worthwhile in general. In general, they should drop stuff that is useful to players of all levels and be be more exciting to hunt for.  

### How Are They Different? 
The drop charts are mostly the same, but the rates have been heavily modified. Some items are shifted to better match the beacon associated with the level of the engram. Items that could not be previously found anywhere have been added. This includes ammo, rare resources, eggs, patterns for industrial items and cannons, and much more. The equip-able gear has been adjusted to always drop individual pieces and patterns when it does drop while having a chance to be a little better than previously. Anything found in the Sea Crates will not be found in any of these Beacons (as the devs intended). In extremely rare cases, the gear found here drop will be very high quality. This is so rare, that you would have to be a dedicated beacon hunter (or just damn lucky) to come across the best of the gear. You can find the [**full drop chart here**](https://github.com/bytePro17124/CustomArkLootDrops/blob/master/FULL_SUDO_CODE.md).  

###How to Use?  
The easiest way to use this is to copy all the code from the file *FULL_DEPLOY_CODE* and paste it into your *game.ini* file, anywhere under the [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]. Then Save your server and restart it (be sure to warn your players so they dont lose stuff/can land their fliers, all that standard stuff). If you are still stuck on this, there is a lot of additional information out there about editing your game.ini file, just search Google.
