# CustomArkLootDrops
Improved, yet not OverPowered, Beacons

The goal here is to improve the default beacons and crates in ARK.

The problem with the current crates is CROP PLOTS, COMPASSES, WATER JARS. I can only imagine the count of people who have rage quit this game based on getting those items in crates OVER AND OVER
