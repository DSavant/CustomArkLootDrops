todo:  
	add lystro eggs to white/fix white egg drops
	add metal fence foundation somewhere (yellow?)
	add stone behemoth gateway and gate somewhere
	add metal behemoth gateway and gate somewhere
	add transponder node and tracker somewhere - in with gps area
	remove frog saddle (since its in sea crates) - removed from blue
	reduce quantity of chitin, improve quality a notch
	blue spawns stone house but sometimes inconsistant - fixed and learned some about sets (order of set items does not matter)
	repellant numbers seem a little high in green and white
	green sometimes has a toooon of stuff

Questions I have:
	Does item entries order matter?  seems like no, decently confirmed with stone house test example in blue crates
	Does set entries order matter?
	Should the set weights and entry weights add up the something specific, like 100?
